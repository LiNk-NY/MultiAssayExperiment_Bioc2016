# Overview of the `MultiAssayExperiment` class

```{r}
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
empty <- MultiAssayExperiment()
empty
slotNames(empty)
```

## Components of the MultiAssayExperiment

### Elist: experiment data

The `Elist` slot and class is the container workhorse for the `MultiAssayExperiment` class. 
It contains all the experiment data. It inherits from class `S4Vectors::SimpleList` with
one element/component per experiment type.

```{r}
class(Elist(empty)) 
```
The elements of the `Elist` can contain **ID-based** and **range-based** data.
Requirements for all classes in the `Elist` are listed in the API, see `API()` for details. 
These familiar base and Bioconductor classes are supported: 

- `matrix`: the base class, can be used for ID-based datasets such as gene expression
summarized per-gene, microRNA, metabolomics, or microbiome data. 

- `Biobase::ExpressionSet`: A richer representation of ID-based datasets with additional
assay-level metadata.

- `SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment`: Also provides a rich representation of ID-based
datasets matrix-like datasets.

- `SummarizedExperiment::RangedSummarizedExperiment`: For rectangular range-based datasets,
one set of genomic ranges are assayed for multiple samples. It can be used for gene
expression, methylation, or other data types that refer to genomic positions. 

- `MultiAssayExperiment::RangedRaggedAssay`: inherits from `GRangesList`, for ranged-based
ragged arrays, meaning that a potentially different set of genomic ranges are assayed
for each sample.  A typical example would be segmented copy number, where
segmentation of copy number alterations occurs and different genomic
locations in each sample.

#### Class requirements within Elist container

The datasets contained in elements of the `Elist` must have:

* column names
* row names

The column names correspond to samples, and are used to match assay data to specimen
metadata stored in `pData`. 

The row names can correspond to a variety of features in the data including but not
limited to gene names, probe IDs, proteins, and named ranges. 

##### Methods

Classes contained in the `Elist` must support the following list of methods:

- `[`: standard square bracket subsetting, with a single comma. It is assumed
that values before the comma subset rows, and values after the comma subset
columns.
- `colnames()`: corresponding to experimental samples
- `rownames()`: corresponding to features such as genes, proteins, etc.
- `dim()`: returns a vector of the number of rows and number of columns

### pData: primary data

The `MultiAssayExperiment` keeps one set of "primary" metadata that describes
the 'biological unit' which can refer to specimens, experiment subject, patients,
etc. In this tutorial, we will refer to each experiment subject as a *patient*.

#### pData slot requirements

The `pData` dataset should be of class `DataFrame` but can accept a `data.frame` class
object that will subsequently be coerced.  

In order to relate metadata of the biological unit, the row names of the `pData` dataset
must contain patient identifiers. 

```{r}
patient.data <- data.frame(sex=c("M", "F", "M", "F"),
    age=38:41,
    row.names=c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Barbara"))
patient.data
```
### sampleMap: relating pData to multiple assays

`sampleMap` is a `DataFrame` that provides a map between the "primary" data
(`pData`) and the experimental assays:

```{r}
class(sampleMap(empty)) 
```

The `sampleMap` provides an unambiguous map from every experimental
observation to *one and only one* row in `pData`. It is, however, permissible
for a row of `pData` to be associated with multiple experimental observations
or no observations at all.  In other words, there is a "many-to-one" mapping
from experimental observations to rows of `pData`, and a "one-to-any-number"
mapping from rows of `pData` to experimental observations.

#### sampleMap structure

`pData` has three columns, with the following column names:

1. **primary** provides the "primary" sample names.  All values in this column
must also be present in the rownames of pData(MultiAssayExperiment).
In this example, allowable values in this column are "Jack", "Jill",
"Barbara", and "Bob".

2. **assay** provides the sample names used by experimental datasets, which
in practice are often different than the primary sample names.  For each assay,
all column names must be found in this column.  Otherwise, those assays would
be orphaned: it would be impossible to match them up to samples in the overall
experiment. As mentioned above, duplicated values are allowed, to represent
replicates with the same overall experiment-level annotation.

3. **assayname** provides the names of the different experiments / assays
performed. These are user-defined, with the only requirement that the names
of the `Elist`, where the experimental assays are stored, must be contained
in this column.

##### Instances where sampleMap isn't provided 

If each assay uses the same colnames (i.e., if the same sample identifiers are
used for each experiment), a simple list of these datasets is sufficient for
the `MultiAssayExperiment()` constructor function.  It is not necessary for
them to have the same rownames or colnames:

```{r}
exprss1 <- matrix(rnorm(16), ncol = 4,
        dimnames = list(sprintf("ENST00000%i", sample(288754:290000, 4)),
                c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Bobby")))
exprss2 <- matrix(rnorm(12), ncol = 3,
        dimnames = list(sprintf("ENST00000%i", sample(288754:290000, 4)),
                c("Jack", "Jane", "Bob")))
doubleExp <- list("methyl 2k"  = exprss1, "methyl 3k" = exprss2)
simpleMultiAssay <- MultiAssayExperiment(Elist=doubleExp)
simpleMultiAssay
```

In the above example, the user did not provide the `pData` argument so the
constructor function filled it with a trivial DataFrame:

```{r}
pData(simpleMultiAssay)
```

But the `pData` can be provided.  Here, note that any assay sample (column) that
cannot be mapped to a corresponding row in the provided `pData` gets dropped.
This is part of ensuring internal validity of the `MultiAssayExperiment`.
```{r}
simpleMultiAssay2 <- MultiAssayExperiment(Elist=doubleExp, pData=patient.data)
simpleMultiAssay2
pData(simpleMultiAssay2)
```

### metadata

Can be of *ANY* class, for storing study-wide metadata, such as citation information.
For an empty `MultiAssayExperiment` object, it is NULL. 

```{r}
class(metadata(empty)) # NULL (class "ANY")
```

# Creating a `MultiAssayExperiment` object: a rich example

In this section we demonstrate all core supported data classes, using different
sample ID conventions for each assay, with primary pData. The some 
supported classes such as, `matrix`, `ExpressionSet`, 
`SummarizedExperiment`, `RangedSummarizedExperiment`, and `RangedRaggedAssay`.

## Create toy datasets demonstrating all supported data types

We have three matrix-like datasets.  First let's say expression data,
which in this example we represent as an `ExpressionSet`:


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(Biobase)
(arraydat <- matrix(seq(101, 108), ncol=4,
                    dimnames=list(c("ENST00000294241", "ENST00000355076"),
                                  c("array1", "array2", "array3", "array4"))))
arraypdat <- as(data.frame(slope53=rnorm(4),
                           row.names=c("array1", "array2", "array3",
                                       "array4")), "AnnotatedDataFrame")
exprdat <- ExpressionSet(assayData=arraydat, phenoData=arraypdat)
exprdat
```

The following map matches pData sample names to exprdata sample
names.  Note that row orders aren't initially matched up, and this is OK.

```{r}
(exprmap <- data.frame(primary=rownames(patient.data)[c(1, 2, 4, 3)],
                       assay=c("array1", "array2", "array3", "array4"),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Now methylation data, which we will represent as a `matrix`.  It uses
gene identifiers also, but measures a partially overlapping set of genes.
For fun, let's store this as a simple matrix. Also, it contains a replicate
for one of the patients.

```{r}
(methyldat <-
   matrix(1:10, ncol=5,
          dimnames=list(c("ENST00000355076", "ENST00000383706"),
                        c("methyl1", "methyl2", "methyl3",
                          "methyl4", "methyl5"))))
```

The following map matches pData sample names to methyldat sample
names.

```{r}
(methylmap <- data.frame(primary = c("Jack", "Jack", "Jill", "Barbara", "Bob"),
              assay = c("methyl1", "methyl2", "methyl3", "methyl4", "methyl5"),
              stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Now we have a microRNA platform, which has no common identifiers with the
other datasets, and which we also represent as a `matrix`.  It
is also missing data for Jill.  Just for fun, let's use the same
sample naming convention as we did for arrays.

```{r}
(microdat <- matrix(201:212, ncol=3,
                    dimnames=list(c("hsa-miR-21", "hsa-miR-191",
                                    "hsa-miR-148a", "hsa-miR148b"),
                                  c("micro1", "micro2", "micro3"))))
```

And the following map matches pData sample names to microdat
sample names.

```{r}
(micromap <- data.frame(primary = c("Jack", "Barbara", "Bob"),
                        assay = c("micro1", "micro2", "micro3"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Let's include a `RangedRaggedAssay`, which is defined in this package and
extends `GRangesList`.  This is intended for data such as segmented copy
number, which provide genomic ranges that may be different for each sample.
We start with a `GRangesList`, which will later be converted automatically
by the `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GenomicRanges))
## completely encompasses ENST00000355076
gr1 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = "chr3", ranges = IRanges(58000000, 59502360),
          strand = "+", score = 5L, GC = 0.45)
## first is within ENST0000035076
gr2 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = c("chr3", "chr3"),
          ranges = IRanges(c(58493000, 3), width=9000),
          strand = c("+", "-"), score = 3:4, GC = c(0.3, 0.5))
gr3 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1", "chr2"),
          ranges = IRanges(c(1, 4), c(3, 9)),
          strand = c("-", "-"), score = c(6L, 2L), GC = c(0.4, 0.1))
grl <- GRangesList("gr1" = gr1, "gr2" = gr2, "gr3" = gr3)
names(grl) <- c("snparray1", "snparray2", "snparray3")
grl
```

The following `data.frame` matches pData sample to the
`GRangesList`:

```{r}
(rangemap <- data.frame(primary = c("Jack", "Jill", "Jill"),
                        assay = c("snparray1", "snparray2", "snparray3"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Finally, we create a dataset of class `RangedSummarizedExperiment`:

```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
nrows <- 5; ncols <- 4
counts <- matrix(runif(nrows * ncols, 1, 1e4), nrows)
rowRanges <- GRanges(rep(c("chr1", "chr2"), c(2, nrows - 2)),
                     IRanges(floor(runif(nrows, 1e5, 1e6)), width=100),
                     strand=sample(c("+", "-"), nrows, TRUE),
                     feature_id=sprintf("ID\\%03d", 1:nrows))
names(rowRanges) <- letters[1:5]
colData <- DataFrame(Treatment=rep(c("ChIP", "Input"), 2),
                     row.names= c("mysnparray1", "mysnparray2",
                                  "mysnparray3", "mysnparray4"))
rse <- SummarizedExperiment(assays=SimpleList(counts=counts),
                            rowRanges=rowRanges, colData=colData)
```

```{r}
(rangemap2 <-
   data.frame(primary = c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Barbara"),
              assay = c("mysnparray1", "mysnparray2", "mysnparray3",
                        "mysnparray4"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

## sampleMap creation

The `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function can create the `sampleMap`
automatically if a single naming convention is used, but in this example
it cannot because we used platform-specific sample identifiers
(e.g. mysnparray1, etc). So we must provide an ID  map that matches the
samples of each experiment back to the `pData`, as a three-column
`data.frame` or `DataFrame` with three columns named "primary", "assay",
and "assayname".  Here we start with a list:

```{r}
listmap <- list(exprmap, methylmap, micromap, rangemap, rangemap2)
names(listmap) <- c("Affy", "Methyl 450k", "Mirna", "CNV gistic", "CNV gistic2")
listmap
```

and use the convenience function `listToMap` to convert the list of `data.frame`
objects to a valid object for the `sampleMap`:

```{r}
dfmap <- listToMap(listmap)
dfmap
```

Note, `dfmap` can be reverted to a list with another provided function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapToList(dfmap, "assayname")
```

## Experimental data as a `list()`
Create an named list of experiments for the MultiAssay function. All of these
names must be found within in the third column of `dfmap`:

```{r}
objlist <- list("Affy" = exprdat, "Methyl 450k" = methyldat,
                "Mirna" = microdat, "CNV gistic" = grl, "CNV gistic2" = rse)
```

## Creation of the `MultiAssayExperiment` class object

We recommend using the `MultiAssayExperiment()` constructor function:

```{r}
myMultiAssay <- MultiAssayExperiment(objlist, patient.data, dfmap)
myMultiAssay
```

The following extractor functions can be used to get extract data from
the object:

```{r}
Elist(myMultiAssay)
pData(myMultiAssay)
sampleMap(myMultiAssay)
metadata(myMultiAssay)
```

Note that the `Elist` class extends the `SimpleList` class to add some
validity checks specific to `MultiAssayExperiment`.  It can be used like
a list.

## Helper function to create a `MultiAssayExperiment` object

The `PrepMultiAssay` function helps diagnose common problems when creating a
`MultiAssayExperiment` object. It provides error messages and/or warnings in
instances where names (either `colnames` or `Elist` element names) are
inconsistent with those found in the sampleMap. Input arguments are the same
as those in the `MultiAssayExperiment` (i.e., `Elist`, `pData`, `sampleMap`).
The resulting output of the `PrepMultiAssay` function is a list of inputs
including a "drops" element for names that were not able to be matched.

Instances where `Elist` is created without names will prompt an error
from `PrepMultiAssay`. Named `Elist` elements are essential for checks in
`MultiAssayExperiment`.

```{r}
objlist3 <- objlist
(names(objlist3) <- NULL)
try(PrepMultiAssay(objlist3, patient.data, dfmap)$Elist)
```

Non-matching names may also be present in the `Elist` elements and the
"assayname" column of the `sampleMap`. If names only differ by case and are
identical and unique, names will be standardized to lower case and replaced.

```{r}
names(objlist3) <- toupper(names(objlist))
names(objlist3)
unique(dfmap[, "assayname"])
PrepMultiAssay(objlist3, patient.data, dfmap)$Elist
```

When `colnames` in the `Elist` cannot be matched back to the primary data
(`pData`), these will be dropped and added to the drops element. 

```{r}
exampleMap <- sampleMap(simpleMultiAssay2)
sapply(doubleExp, colnames)
exampleMap
PrepMultiAssay(doubleExp, patient.data, exampleMap)$drops
```

A similar operation is performed for checking "primary" sampleMap names and
`pData` rownames. In this example, we add a row corresponding to "Joe" that
does not have a match in the experiment data.

```{r}
exMap <- rbind(dfmap,
               DataFrame(primary = "Joe",
                         assay = "Joe",
                         assayname = "New methyl"))
PrepMultiAssay(objlist, patient.data, exMap)$drops
```

To create a `MultiAssayExperiment` from the results of the `PrepMultiAssay`
function, take each corresponding element from the resulting list and enter
them as arguments to the `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function.

```{r}
prepped <- PrepMultiAssay(objlist, patient.data, exMap)
preppedMulti <- MultiAssayExperiment(prepped$Elist, prepped$pData, prepped$sampleMap)
preppedMulti
```

# `RangedRaggedAssay` class

Note that the GRangesList got converted to a `RangedRaggedAssay`, a class
intended for data such as segmented copy number that is provides different
genomic ranges for each sample. `RangedRaggedAssay` is defined by this
package and inherits from `GRangesList`:

```{r}
methods(class="RangedRaggedAssay")
getMethod("colnames", "RangedRaggedAssay")
```

It has some additional methods that are required for any data class contained
in a `MultiAssayExperiment`:

```{r}
class(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
rownames(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
colnames(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
```

One of the requirements for the `assay` method (specifically for this
`RangedRaggedAssay` `Elist` element) is that the metadata have a `score` column
from which to obtain values for the resulting assay matrix. Here we add
ficticious values to such column contained within list elements. See
`assay,RangedRaggedAssay,ANY-method` documentation.

```{r}
metadata(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]]) <- list(snparray1 = DataFrame(score = 1),
                                           snparray2 = DataFrame(score = 1),
                                           snparray3 = DataFrame(score = 3))
assay(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]], background = 2)
```

# Integrated subsetting across experiments

The core functionality of `MultiAssayExperiment` is to allow subsetting by
assay, rownames, and colnames, across all experiments simultaneously while
guaranteeing continued matching of samples.

## Subsetting samples / columns

Experimental samples are stored in the rows of pData but the columns of
elements of Elist, so when we refer to subsetting by columns, we are referring
to columns of the experimental assays.  Subsetting by samples / columns will
be more obvious after recalling the pData:

```{r}
pData(myMultiAssay)
```

Subsetting by samples identifies the selected samples in rows of the pData
DataFrame, then selects all columns of the Elist corresponding to these rows.
Here we use an integer to keep the first two rows of pData, and all
experimental assays associated to those two primary samples:

```{r}
subsetByColumn(myMultiAssay, 1:2)
```

Note that the above operation keeps different numbers of columns / samples
from each assay, reflecting the reality that some samples may not have been
assayed in all experiments, and may have replicates in some.

Subsetting the primary identifiers using a character vector corresponding to
some rownames of pData returns the same result:

```{r}
subsetByColumn(myMultiAssay, c("Jack", "Jill"))
```

Columns can be subset using a logical:
```{r}
malesMultiAssay <- subsetByColumn(myMultiAssay, pData(myMultiAssay)$sex=="M")
pData(malesMultiAssay)
```

Note that selecting male patients from all assays could have been accomplished
equivalently using the square bracket:

```{r}
myMultiAssay[, pData(myMultiAssay)$sex=="M", ]
```

Finally, for special use cases you can exert detail control of which samples
to select using a `list` or `CharacterList`, which is just a convenient form
of a list containing character vectors.

```{r}
allsamples <- colnames(myMultiAssay)
allsamples
```

Now let's get rid of the Methyl 450k arrays 3-5, a couple different but
equivalent ways:

```{r}
allsamples[["Methyl 450k"]] <- allsamples[["Methyl 450k"]][-3:-5]
myMultiAssay[, as.list(allsamples), ]
```

## Subsetting assays

You can select certain assays / experiments using subset, by providing a
character, logical, or integer vector.  An example using character:

```{r}
subsetByAssay(myMultiAssay, c("Affy", "CNV gistic"))
```

Examples using logical and integer:
```{r}
is.cnv = grepl("CNV", names(Elist(myMultiAssay)))
is.cnv
subsetByAssay(myMultiAssay, is.cnv)
subsetByAssay(myMultiAssay, which(is.cnv))
```

`subsetByRow`, `subsetByColumn`, and `subsetByAssay` are endogenous operations,
in that it always returns another `MultiAssayExperiment` object.
Use `assay(myMultiAssay)` to retrieve the experimental data in an ordinary
`list` of datasets as their original classes.

## Subsetting rows (features) by IDs, integers, or logicals

Rows of the assays correspond to assay features or measurements, such as genes.
Regardless of whether the assay is ID-based (e.g. matrix, ExpressionSet) or
range-based (e.g. RangedSummarizedExperiment, RangedRaggedAssay), they can be
subset using any of:

- a **character vector** of IDs that will be matched to rownames in each assay

- an **integer vector** that will select rows of this position from each assay.
This probably doesn't make sense unless every Elist element represents the
same measurements in the same order and will generate an error if any of the
integer elements exceeds the number of rows in any Elist element. The most
likely use of integer subsetting would as a "head()" function, for example to
look at the first 6 rows of each assay.

- a **logical vector** that will be passed directly to the row subsetting
operation for each assay.  A warning is issued if this results in recycling
for any of the assays.

- a **list** or **CharacterList** of the same length as Elist.  Each element
of the subsetting list will be passed on exactly to subset rows of the
corresponding element of Elist.

Again, this operation always returns a `MultiAssayExperiment` class, unless
"drop=TRUE" is passed to subset, with any `Elist` element not containing the
feature having zero rows.

For example, return a MultiAssayExperiment where `Affy` and `Methyl 450k`
contain only ENST0000035076 row, and "Mirna" and "CNV gistic" have zero rows:
(`drop` argument is set to `TRUE` by default)

```{r}
featSubsetted0 <- subsetByRow(myMultiAssay, "ENST00000355076")
class(featSubsetted0)
class(Elist(featSubsetted0))
Elist(featSubsetted0)
```

In the following, `Affy` ExpressionSet keeps both rows but with their
order reversed, and `Methyl 450k` keeps only its second row.

```{r}
featSubsetted <-
  subsetByRow(myMultiAssay, c("ENST00000355076", "ENST00000294241"))
exprs(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[1]])
exprs(Elist(featSubsetted)[[1]])
```

## Subsetting rows (features) by `GenomicRanges`

For `MultiAssayExperiment` objects containing range-based objects (currently
`RangedSummarizedExperiment` and `RangedRaggedAssay`), these can be subset
using a `GRanges` object, for example:
```{r}
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1"), strand = c("-", "+", "-"),
              ranges = IRanges(start = c(1, 4, 6), width = 3))
```

Now do the subsetting.  The function doing the work here is
`IRanges::subsetByOverlaps` - see its arguments for flexible types of
subsetting by range. The first three arguments here are for `subset`, the
rest passed on to `IRanges::subsetByOverlaps` through "...":

```{r}
subsetted <- subsetByRow(myMultiAssay, gr, maxgap = 2L, type = "within")
Elist(subsetted)
```

## Subsetting by square bracket `[`

The bracket method for the `MultiAssayExperiment` is equivalent but more
compact than the `subsetBy*()` methods. The three positions within the bracket
operator indicate rows, columns, and assays, respectively (pseudocode):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
myMultiAssay[rows, columns, assays]
```

For example, to select the gene ENST00000355076:

```{r}
myMultiAssay["ENST00000355076", , ]
```

The above operation works across all types of assays, whether ID-based
(e.g. matrix, ExpressionSet, SummarizedExperiment) or range-based
(e.g. RangedSummarizedExperiment, RangedRaggedAssay).

You can subset by rows, columns, and assays in a single bracket operation,
and they will be performed in that order (rows, then columns, then assays):

```{r}
myMultiAssay["ENST00000355076", 1:2, c("Affy", "Methyl 450k")]
```

## Subsetting by character, integer, and logical

By columns - character, integer, and logical are all allowed, for example:
```{r}
myMultiAssay[, "Jack", ]
myMultiAssay[, 1, ]
myMultiAssay[, c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), ]
```

By assay - character, integer, and logical are allowed:
```{r}
myMultiAssay[, , "Mirna"]
myMultiAssay[, , 3]
myMultiAssay[, , c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]

## the "drop" argument

Specify `drop=FALSE` to keep assays with zero rows or zero columns, e.g.:

```{r}
myMultiAssay["ENST00000355076", , , drop=FALSE]
```

Using the default `drop=TRUE`, assays with no rows or no columns are removed:

```{r}
myMultiAssay["ENST00000355076", , , drop=TRUE]
```

# rownames and colnames

rownames and colnames return a `CharacterList` of rownames and colnames across
all the assays.  A `CharacterList` is just an alternative to `list` when each
element contains a character vector, that provides a nice show method:

```{r}
rownames(myMultiAssay)
colnames(myMultiAssay)
```
